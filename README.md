# Usage

- Select "hid" in "USB function" under "USB arsenal" in Nethunter app. Select "Set USB Function".  
- Install "Ducky" from Nethunter app store.  
- Copy the script and make changes whereever required.  
- Enable USB debugging from Developer option in phone.
- Connect usb cable to any system and execute the script.  

**NOTE:** This will work only when you "always allow" usb debugging to the computer you are connecting at least once because it uses adb to copy file to phone memory.
